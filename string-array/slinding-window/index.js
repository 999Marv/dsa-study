/*

Similar to two pointer
Works with ordered elements
usully works on subarray

sliding window problems can sound like:

- Find the longest subarray with a sum less than or equal to k
- Find the longest substring that has at most one "0"
- Find the number of subarrays that have a product less than k

The idea behind a sliding window is to consider only valid subarrays.
